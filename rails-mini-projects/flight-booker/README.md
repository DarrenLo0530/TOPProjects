# Flight Booker

A project to practice backend relationships and advanced form functionality.\
Uses nested forms to create a Booking model while also creating Passenger models at the same time.\

Things I learned: 
* Bulma and how it differs from Bootstrap
* Nested forms and models
* Allowing inputs for one model to be used to create models that are it's children (accepts_nested_attributes_for)
